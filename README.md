# E-Commerce Website

This is a fully functional e-commerce website developed as part of my full-stack web development bootcamp. The project showcases core front-end skills, browser storage techniques, and performance features using:

- **HTML** and **CSS** for structure and styling
- **Bootstrap** for responsive design
- **JavaScript** for interactivity and dynamic behavior
- **LocalStorage** and **cookies** to manage user preferences and shopping cart data
- **Service Workers** to enable offline functionality

The site features a product catalog, add-to-cart functionality, and stores user preferences such as currency and name for a more personalized experience.
